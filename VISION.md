# Budy: Project Vision

## Purpose
Budy exists to enhance the terminal experience by combining AI-powered assistance with intuitive command-line usage. By providing an intelligent, learning assistant that integrates seamlessly with everyday terminal workflows, Budy aims to make command-line interaction more efficient, intuitive, and personalized.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Budy should remain easy to use with minimal cognitive overhead. The interface should feel natural for terminal users without complex commands or configurations.

2. **Intelligence**: Budy should learn from user behavior and provide increasingly relevant suggestions and assistance over time.

3. **Privacy**: User data should remain local by default, with clear opt-in for any data sharing or cloud storage.

4. **Extensibility**: The system should be designed for easy extension with new capabilities and integrations.

5. **Standard Library First**: Rely on Go's standard library wherever possible to minimize dependencies and maintain long-term stability.

## Current State

Budy currently provides:
- Basic command execution and history tracking
- Simple suggestion engine based on time and directory patterns
- AI-powered answers to questions via OpenAI integration
- Local storage of command history and preferences

## Strategic Roadmap

### Long-term Vision (1+ years)
- Improve suggestion algorithms with more sophisticated pattern recognition
- Add command completion based on history and context
- Implement custom command aliases and shortcuts
- Add local caching of common AI responses for faster answers
- Develop a plug-in system for custom extensions
- Add support for multiple AI providers beyond OpenAI
- Create visualization tools for command usage patterns
- Implement workflow automation for repeated command sequences
- Add cross-device history synchronization (optional, privacy-preserving
- Develop sophisticated ML models for command prediction that can run locally
- Create a collaborative command sharing platform (opt-in)
- Build integrations with popular developer tools and cloud platforms
- Implement natural language processing for command generation
- Extend to support multiple operating systems beyond macOS

## Technology Choices

- **Go**: Chosen for its simplicity, performance, and cross-platform capabilities
- **Standard Library**: Maximize usage of Go's standard library to minimize dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: Used for AI assistance with the potential to support multiple providers
- **JSON Storage**: Simple file-based storage for maximum compatibility and portability

## Community and Contribution

We envision Budy as a community-driven project where users can easily contribute improvements. By maintaining clear documentation, well-structured code, and a welcoming contribution process, we aim to foster a collaborative development environment.

## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: Growth in downloads and active installations
- **Command Efficiency**: Reduced time spent typing commands
- **Learning Effectiveness**: Improvement in suggestion relevance over time
- **Contribution**: Active community participation and pull requests
- **Feedback**: Positive user testimonials and ratings
